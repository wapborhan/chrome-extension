# momentum_parody
Make a clone of momentum chrome extension which has 3M+ active users

Hello!
There are a few thing you need to do in order to succefully run this chrome extension!

STEP 1: Change image url in homepage.html to a local image or a link, and I have worked out that the size that works the best is 1600 px by 787 px       


STEP 2: Change name from John Doe to your name, this change won't affect the working of the extension if not executed
